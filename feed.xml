<p><strong>Andrew:  </strong>Hey, everyone! It&#8217;s Andrew here and you&#8217;re listening to the Culips English Podcast.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, everyone! We are a few days into 2022 and I hope it&#8217;s going well for you so far. Did you do anything special to ring in the new year? To ring in the new year means to celebrate the new year. And I rang in the new year by having a very small but also very fun party with my wife, it was a party of two, well, three if you include our dog Pinky. Now due to the social distancing rules that are in place right now in South Korea, where we live, we couldn&#8217;t really have a new year&#8217;s party or meet up with any of our friends this year. But we still managed to make the most out of a difficult situation by having this little private party by ourselves. We were given a bottle of champagne as a wedding present after our wedding that happened in May of 2021. So we had some champagne, and we prepared some other tasty snacks as well, and we enjoyed those. We also recently bought a record player and I kind of went on a shopping spree lately, everyone, I spent a little bit too much money buying a bunch of old LP records. So I was the party DJ, and we listened to a bunch of great music and spent the night that way.</p>
<p>Canadians usually think of New Year&#8217;s Eve as a pretty special night and we&#8217;d like to do something fun to ring in the new year. So I&#8217;m glad I was able to carry out that tradition this year, even though we&#8217;re still going through the pandemic. Anyway, everyone in this episode, the Culips team, and I just want to pass on our new year&#8217;s greetings and well wishes to you. This is going to be a short episode and there isn&#8217;t a study guide for it. We did, however, make a transcript and that transcript will be available to everyone. Whether you&#8217;re a Culips Member or not, on our websites, which is Culips.com, C-U-L-I-P-S.com.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from all of the Culips hosts here in just a moment. But before we do, I want to remind everyone about our special new year sale that is happening right now. Until January 15th of 2022, you can save 25% off a yearly Culips membership. A few people have messaged me to ask if this promotion is only available to new members, and the answer to that question is no. Even if you&#8217;re already a member, if you would like to extend your membership for another year, and take advantage of this discounted sale price, you can absolutely do that. Or if you were a member before and your membership recently expired and you want to renew it and take advantage of the discounted price, you can do that as well. No problem.</p>
<p>So everyone, if your goal for 2022 is to improve your English and build fluency in listening, speaking, and pronunciation, then I highly recommend a Culips membership. On top of that, by studying with Culips, you&#8217;ll learn helpful and useful English vocabulary and learn about the culture of English speaking countries and the people who live in them. Culips members get access to all of the tools that we&#8217;ve designed and created to help you learn natural English in a fun, interesting, and immersive way. Some of those tools include access to our entire study guide library for all of our episodes. And these days, we have over 600 episodes, we&#8217;ve got tons of material. You&#8217;ll also get transcripts for all of those episodes plus access to our members only series, which is called the Fluency Files. Plus, you&#8217;ll get other great extras like ad-free audio, invitations to the monthly video live streams that Kassy and I host, playlists, a community forum and more. There are a ton of great benefits you get when you are a Culips member. The reason that the Culips team and I make Culips and do Culips is because we&#8217;re passionate language learners ourselves. We love learning languages and we want to make learning English enjoyable and easy for you.</p>
<p>Of course, learning English is difficult and we can&#8217;t really change that. No matter how you learn whether it&#8217;s with Culips, or a different program, or a different app, or a different book, or a different class, no matter how you learn, you&#8217;ll have to commit many hours to learning English, there&#8217;s no way around that. But here at Culips we provide you with all of the content and learning materials you need, in one easy place. All the resources you need to improve and reach the next level in your English, they&#8217;re here for you. And of course, we have new episodes always coming out each week, which makes learning English with Culips, very fresh and relevant. I get emails all the time from Culips members who tell me that they&#8217;ve been able to level up their English fluency, after learning with us for a year. Now, I can honestly tell you that I&#8217;ve never once heard from a Culips member who&#8217;s said something like, &#8220;Andrew after becoming a Culips member and studying with Culips for a year, my English didn&#8217;t improve.&#8221; It&#8217;s never happened. I&#8217;ve never heard anything like that. Of course, some people have told me that they weren&#8217;t able to make as much progress as they would have liked, because they got busy, or they weren&#8217;t able to commit any time to learning English. That&#8217;s natural and to be expected, no matter what you&#8217;re learning, right? You can&#8217;t learn to play the piano, or run a marathon either if you can&#8217;t commit time to practicing, and learning. But guys, I can promise you that if you can find time in your schedule to regularly study with Culips and the learning materials you&#8217;ll get when you&#8217;re a Culips member, you&#8217;ll be able to improve your English fluency this year.</p>
<p>So anyways, everyone, I&#8217;m going to end my sales pitch here. We&#8217;re really proud of what we do at Culips and we depend on your support to allow us to continue making English lessons for learners all over the world. The new year sale runs until January 15th of 2022. And once again, if you sign up for a yearly membership during the sale period, you can save 25%. So to learn more, and to sign up, just visit Culips.com,  C-U-L-I-P-S.com. So I asked the Culips team to pass on their new year well wishes to all of you guys, all of our listeners. We&#8217;ll start with Kassy, we&#8217;ll hear from her first because she has a short, sweet, and motivational message for everyone learning English with us. So let&#8217;s take a listen to Kassy&#8217;s new year&#8217;s message now.</p>
<p><strong>Kassy:</strong>  2022 is your year and you should climb your way to the top.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong>  One thing that I really like about Kassy is that she really lives life to the fullest. She&#8217;s a super active person, and she&#8217;s always doing new things, learning new things, upgrading her qualifications, starting new projects, etc. etc.. I want to quickly break down what Kassy just said and explain it to you all. So let&#8217;s listen to the first part of Kassy&#8217;s message one more time.</p>
<p><strong>Kassy:</strong>  2022 is your year. 2022 is your year.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong>  So she said 2022 is your year. 2022 is your year. And what Kassy means here is that if you commit to achieving your goals this year, you can definitely achieve them, OK? This is the year where you can do what you want to do. It&#8217;s that kind of nuance to this expression. And in the second part of her message, Kassy said,</p>
<p><strong>Kassy:</strong>  And you should climb your way to the top. And you should climb your way to the top.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong>  You should climb your way to the top, you should climb your way to the top. OK, so here she uses a mountain climbing metaphor. What she means is that you should be active this year and work towards reaching your goals and becoming the person that you want to be during 2022 So thank you, Kassy for passing on that motivational message to us all. Now let&#8217;s hear from Anna the newest Culips co-host. Here&#8217;s what Anna had to say.</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>  I hope you have a wonderful new year and I hope you start the new year feeling relaxed, looking forward to 2022 and all the exciting things that are gonna come up and I hope that you stay tuned to Culips as well for even more English learning.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong>  Fantastic! Okay, thank you very much for that great message, Anna. And finally, we have a message from Suzanne as well. Now Suzanne called me from her parents&#8217; house in Texas. So she didn&#8217;t have her microphone with her at that time, but it&#8217;s OK, you&#8217;ll be able to understand her without any problems. So let&#8217;s hear what Suzanne had to say in her New Year&#8217;s message to you all.</p>
<p><strong>Suzanne:</strong>  I would love to pass on to our listeners that doing just a little something every day, especially in your new language, whether you&#8217;re learning English, whether you&#8217;re studying pronunciation in English, just doing five minutes, or just a little something every single day is going to build big results, good habits. So just keep going. That&#8217;s something I really wish for you guys in the new year. And also, just to stay positive. I know that there&#8217;s so much in this world right now, but it could be a little stressful, very stressful, overwhelming, but to continue to stay optimistic and look for the possibilities. All right, guys, I&#8217;m wishing you so much joy, so much happiness, and just peace and ease in the next year into 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong>  I love that. Thank you, Suzanne. And Suzanne, I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more in saying that I wish all of our listeners peace and happiness in this new year, especially peace. I think that is my theme for 2022. Finding and living in peace.</p>
<p>And listeners, I hope that no matter what your goal is, and no matter what person you want to become this year, that you can make some progress toward achieving your goals. Now, I can&#8217;t help you with everything and all of your goals, but if your goal is to improve your English this year, then I hope that the Culips team and I can help you out. This year, we&#8217;re going to continue to work hard and to make sure that we can achieve our goal, which is making super educational, useful, motivational, and interesting English lessons for you all. So that&#8217;s it for now, everyone. I&#8217;m going to wrap things up here. Thanks for making it to the end of this episode. Don&#8217;t forget about our 25% off New Year sale that&#8217;s running until January 15th, 2022. And for all the details and to sign up just visit Culips.com, C-U-L-I-P-S.com.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;For some, 2021 was a lot better than 2020. However, that is not the case for everyone.
                We’re all still dealing with the COVID pandemic. In this episode, the Culips team looks back at some of
                the highs and lows of the last year. Simplified Speech is a series meant for intermediate English
                language learners.&lt;a class=&quot;read-more&quot; href=&quot;https://esl.culips.com/2021/12/simplified-speech-136-how-was-your-2021/&quot;&gt;Read

<p>In this episode, our hosts go over how to respond to the doctor’s polite requests. They also help you with some dental vocabulary, such as molar, canine, incisor, and gum tenderness.

One of the main expressions from this episode is a rude awakening. Although unrelated to this expression, you might want to check out the Academy Award–nominated 1990 movie called Awakenings, starring Robert De Niro and Robert Williams. It’s a touching movie about a doctor’s relationships while helping his catatonic patients. If you see it, tell us what you think!<br />

Fun facts<br />
How do buffet restaurants make money if people can eat as much as they want? What you might not know is that these restaurants have strategies to stop customers from eating more expensive foods. For example, they might put cheaper and more filling foods like pasta and potatoes at the front of the buffet line. They also tend to have bigger spoons for these dishes, to encourage you to take more.<br />

Fun facts<br />
Chill was first used as slang to mean something other than cold in 1980. Most of the definitions in this episode come from the idea that, when it’s cold, we move more slowly; when we’re calm or relaxed, we also tend to move more slowly. Also, anger, anxiety, sadness, and agitation all tend to be hot emotions—our body temperatures rise. Chill refers to the lower emotional temperature that comes with being calm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Expressions included in the study guide<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Chill (out)!<br />
* Chill (out) with [someone]<br />
* Chillin’<br />
* Chill<br />
* Road rage<br />
* Wait it out<br />

Fun facts<br />
Andrew, and soon Kassy, is in an international marriage in South Korea. There has been a rise in international marriages in South Korea in the past few years, but it looks like the COVID-19 pandemic has changed some things. In 2019, international weddings accounted for 9.8% of all weddings in South Korea. However, that number plummeted to 7.1% in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.<br />

The world&#8217;s first recorded road trip took place in Germany, in 1888. Bertha Benz, wife of the first car inventor, Karl Benz, travelled from Mannheim to Pforzheim with her sons. They travelled 106 km (66 mi) in the third experimental Benz car, which had a maximum speed of 16 km/h (10 m/h). She even took this trip without her husband’s consent or knowledge!<br />

The original Space Race started in the 1950s. In 1957, the USSR launched the first satellite into space called Sputnik. In 1961, they launched the first person into space.<br />
There were many developments over the years, most notably in 1969 when the United States landed the first humans on the moon. The Space Race ended after the collapse of the USSR. After that, countries from both sides of the former Cold War have worked together.<br />

Fun facts<br />
There are thousands of books and articles out in the world telling people how to improve their mental health, sleep patterns, exercise habits, study habits, financial literacy, and much more. What’s interesting is that these articles and books all say the exact same thing to a certain degree. Most self-improvement or self-help books tend to agree that the #1 way to make significant improvements in anything you set out to achieve is to make small, concise goals and then a routine or plan to achieve those goals, and to consistently execute that plan each and every day.<br />

The six degrees of separation theory states that everyone on the planet is connected to one another by six or fewer social connections.

Pretty cool to think about, right?<br />

Fun facts<br />
Some restaurants have reservation lists that are beyond the imagination. One such restaurant is owned and run by chef Damon Baehrel. This chef is unique, because he runs his restaurant out of his home and he goes through every process of the food prep from growing his own produce, to preparing it, cooking it, serving it, and even cleaning the dishes. He prepares a 20+ course meal for each guest and the dining experience is said to take between 5-7 hours! At one point, chef Baehrel had a 6 year wait-list of customers dying to eat at his restaurant.<br />

Expressions included in the study guide<br />

* A party of[number]<br />

Fun facts<br />
According to a 2007 study from the University of Delaware, clumsiness is something we’re born with. They quizzed 1500 student athletes and found that those with the slowest mental reaction times and processing speeds were the most likely to get injured. If you’re a naturally clumsy person, doctors suggest slowing down and taking in your surroundings before you act—that will help reduce the number of accidents.<br />

Fun facts<br />
Have you ever wished you had a better memory? Then you should research the memory palace technique. The memory palace technique has been used for thousands of years to store vast amounts of information inside the mind. To build a memory palace, think of a place that is very familiar to you. As you mentally walk through that place, add details that you don’t want to forget to the surroundings. For example, if you want to remember that your mother’s birthday is on December 16th, 1957, then imagine that one room in your memory palace has a calendar of the year 1957 with your mom’s picture on it; the calendar is turned to the December page and the 16th is circled in red ink. There you have it! Every time you mentally visit that room in your memory palace, you will see that calendar and recall your mother’s birthday.<br />

Fun facts<br />
One of the key phrases we will talk about in this episode is get the show on the road. The exact origin of this phrase is unknown, but people say it refers to travelling circuses and fairs as far back as the early 1900s. Back then, circuses and fairs travelled from city to city, entertaining people along the way. Each time the entertainers packed up their gear and prepared to travel to the next destination, they would literally be getting the show on the road—transporting the show to its next location.<br />

Fun facts<br />
High school electives, classes that students choose outside their core curriculum, help students find hidden talents or passions that might otherwise have gone undiscovered. Being able to choose which classes they want to take gives students more autonomy over their learning, making them more motivated to succeed in the classroom and more interested in the class material. Electives offer students the ability to seek out interests that will help them decide what career goals they want to pursue after graduation..<br />

Fun facts<br />
October 14th is designated as National Dessert Day in the United States. Another fun fact: people get paid to taste test different candies for the market. The average salary for a chocolate taste tester is 20,000 dollars, but the most sought after chocolate tasters can make as much as 100,000 dollars annually. Sounds like a dream come true!<br />

Fun facts<br />
In 1986, before the internet, the Electronic University Network (EUN) offered the first so‑called “online” course; students ran EUN software on their computers and spoke with each other over the phone. It wasn’t until 1994 that the world saw the first truly online course run by the Computer Assisted Learning Center (CALCampus).<br />

<br />
Key points covered in this episode<br />
<br />
Jeremy introduces a bad study habit, which is studying long lists of words. <br />
Studying long lists of words is difficult and ineffective because you can’t use the words when you need them in real life<br />
Memorizing words and their meanings doesn’t give you context for how the word is used by native speakers in real life<br />
Knowing when to use a word is more important that knowing what it means. <br />
Cramming long lists of words can be helpful if you are going to take a test, but for serious language learners, it is not advisable.<br />
<br />
Key Expressions<br />
<br />
* I assure you: what I am saying I believe is the truth<br />
*  I am/was definitely guilty of ___action____ : Other people have done __action_____ and I have also done ___action____<br />
* That’s all I have: this is the end of what I have prepared to say to you<br />
* In other words: I am going to say what I just said in a different way and simplify it<br />

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this week’s Catch Word episode, Andrew and Jeremy explain three everyday expressions using the word slip: slip up, to slip [one’s] mind, and to slip through [one’s] fingers.<br />
If you don’t know what <a href="https://esl.culips.com/category/catch-word/">Catch Word</a> is, well, let me explain. It is the series where we teach you interesting English vocabulary that is very useful for your everyday life when you are speaking English or especially when you are listening to English. So in Catch Word, we focus on idioms, phrasal verbs, or expressions that are just a little bit difficult. They’re on the difficult side.<br />
Our first expression for today is a phrasal verb, to slip up, to slip up. Now since our episode is related to this word slip, it’s at the centre of each of the expressions that we’ll check out, maybe we should talk about the core meaning of slip. Our second expression for this episode is to slip someone’s mind or that slipped my mind<br />
We also look at another expression, which is to slip through someone’s fingers. Usually we use this expression when we’re talking about opportunities, and especially when we miss out or we lose an opportunity.<br />

<br />
Fun facts<br />
There are an estimated 60 different phrases that use the word slip. From slip of the tongue (when you accidentally say something you don’t mean) to slipping one over on someone (when you deceive someone), each phrase has a unique meaning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Expressions included in the study guide<br />
<br />

<br />
* Slip up<br />
* To know [something] all too well<br />

In this Chatterbox episode, you’ll get to listen to the second part of my interview with YouTuber and language education expert Robin MacPherson. So if you haven’t heard <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2021/02/chatterbox-263-interview-with-robin-macpherson-part-1/">Part 1</a> yet, make sure to check that episode out first. And then you can come back and listen to the second part of the interview here.<br />
In <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2021/02/chatterbox-263-interview-with-robin-macpherson-part-1/">Part 1</a> of the interview, Robin started to share <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2021/02/chatterbox-263-interview-with-robin-macpherson-part-1/">the five-step method</a> that he has for how to learn a language. And in our situation here, we focused on English by using a podcast. Quiz time: Do you remember what steps 1 to 3 were? Those are the steps we covered in Part 1 of the interview. Well, if you can’t remember, that’s all right. Let me refresh your memory in case you forgot. Step 1: listen for the gist and general meaning. Step 2: study with a transcript. And step 3: listen again, many times.<br />

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode, we are going to be talking about taking a break. Now I often get this question from language learners all over the world, and it is, &#8220;Is it okay to take a break from studying?&#8221; Now I understand why most people ask this question. For those of us who are really serious about learning a language, we sometimes feel like if we stop, we are going to lose what we have gained. In other words, we feel like if we take a break for too long, we might lose all of our language learning progress.<br />
Burnout is what happens when you have been working too hard for too long, and your brain is exhausted. I&#8217;m sure we have all had this experience at some point in our life. Burnout in language learning can actually be very dangerous in the sense that it might knock you off your language learning journey. It might lead to you quitting or stopping your language learning all together. And of course, this is not what we want. So in order to avoid burnout, I recommend taking a break from time to time, a day, maybe a few days, or even a week is usually enough for you to renew your spirits and come back to your language studies refreshed and ready for more.<br />
<br />

<br />
Key points covered in this episode<br />
<br />
* Very long breaks can have negative effects on your English ability, but regular study can help you regain your progress quickly.<br />
* Burnout is what happens when you work too hard for too long and this can be detrimental to your language learning efforts.<br />
* Taking a break can help to avoid burnout and can help us to digest what we learn.<br />
* The brain needs time to synthesize and understand linguistic information.<br />
* Grammar is especially difficult to digest, so taking breaks from grammar study can be very helpful. <br />

Hello there language learning friend. Welcome back to Culips. In this episode, I am going to talk about technology. Specifically, I&#8217;ll talk about what kinds of technology I have used to learn Korean and Spanish in the past. Now I should start off by saying when I started learning Korean about 10 years ago, there were very few language learning apps available at the time. I remember the only applications I could find were akin to phrase books. This meant that they had a certain phrase and the translation next to it.<br />
First of all, if you have a smartphone, I highly recommend utilising your smartphone for <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2019/11/jeremys-english-tips-episode-2-repetitive-listening/">repetitive listening</a>. If you are unfamiliar with repetitive listening, please refer to <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2019/11/jeremys-english-tips-episode-2-repetitive-listening/">episode #2</a> and <a href="https://esl.culips.com/2020/05/jeremys-english-tips-episode-16-how-to-choose-good-repetitive-listening-material/">episode #16</a> in the Culips series Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips to find out more about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this episode<br />
<br />
* You can use a smartphone, MP3 or computer to practice listening.<br />
* Good headphones and listening to high quality audio gives your brain more audio information.<br />
* Language exchange apps like HelloTalk and Tandem can help you find language exchange partners and conduct language exchanges.<br />
* You can use online translators to check if your English sentences make sense or not.<br />
* You can check to see if a word or phrase is commonly used by native speakers by putting it in quotations and searching for it on Google.<br />

Hello everyone, this is Jeremy and you&#8217;re listening to Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips, a series by the Culips English Podcast where I teach you interesting expressions or share language learning tips.Welcome back to another episode of the Culips English Podcast series called Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips. In this episode, I&#8217;m going to answer a common question that I get from language learners all over the world. And that question is, how can I know if I&#8217;m improving? Have you ever wondered this yourself? I know that I certainly have. And it can be a frustrating question because what if you&#8217;re not improving? So in this episode, I&#8217;ll tell you about a few things that I have done to check and see if I am improving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this episode<br />
<br />
* You can check to see if you are improving by keeping a repetitive listening habit for a long time and listening back to audio files you used in the past<br />
* You can check on your progress by looking back at old grammar books you used to use to study<br />
* You can know that you are improving by looking back at study notes from the past.<br />
* You know you have improved when certain tasks are easier to accomplish in your target language.<br />
* You can know that you have improved when certain idioms or grammatical forms are easier for you to use now than they used to be.<br />

Occasionally, someone will come to you with bad news. How should you respond? In this Real Talk episode, hosts Andrew and Kassy discuss the different ways you can be a good friend when responding to bad news.<br />
We’re going to listen to a conversation between two friends. And, unfortunately, one of the friends has some bad news to share, because he just failed his driver’s licence test. So we’ll listen to that conversation. And then after we do, Kassy and I will break down that conversation and we’ll take a close look at the expressions that you need to know in order to be able to respond to hearing bad news like this in a very natural way.<br />

In this episode, I am going to teach you about the difference between these three words: but, though, and although. These three words technically mean the same thing, but the way that they are used is different. And they have some very subtle differences. Subtle differences are very small, hard to notice differences. So, I will do my best in this episode to explain those to you and then to give you some examples.<br />
All right, so let&#8217;s start with “but.” Now, the word “but” is a word we use to negate something. &#8220;Negate&#8221; is a rather difficult word, but it is related to the word “negative.” So, to negate something means to put an X on it, to cancel out that other thing, or to say the opposite. For example, “I like apples, but I don&#8217;t eat them often.” Notice in this example, that the word “but” is in the middle of the sentence, and it comes after a verbal pause. &#8220;I like apples &#8211; pause &#8211; but I don&#8217;t eat them often.” This verbal pause shows up in writing as a comma.  So if you are a Culips premium member, and you are following along right now with the study guide, you will see the comma on the page there.  So the word “but” we can say means &#8220;complete negation&#8221;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this episode<br />
<br />
* “But”, “though”, and “although” are three words that mean something very similar in English but have some subtle differences.<br />
* “But” indicates a complete negation and is usually used after a comma, in the middle of a sentence.<br />
* “Though” is usually used at the end of a sentence and indicates a partial negation.<br />
* “Although” is used at the beginning of the sentences and has the same meaning as “though”<br />
* In speech, “but” and “though” can be used at the beginning of a sentence<br />

Introduction transcript<br />
Andrew: Hello there, everyone. My name is Andrew and you&#8217;re listening to the Culips English Podcast. Hey, all! How is it going? How are you doing? I&#8217;m, of course, doing really well. Have you ever heard of the Culips Fluency Files series, it&#8217;s our bonus series that we make exclusively for Culips members. However, today, we&#8217;re going to share an episode of The Fluency Files with everyone. But before we do that, let&#8217;s talk quickly about what the Fluency Files series is, and how you can learn English with it. Well, the Fluency Files series features short audio stories that are designed for intensive English learning and it&#8217;s fantastic to help you develop your English listening, speaking pronunciation and comprehension skills in a fun, efficient, and effective way.<br />
Each episode is short, usually only around three to six minutes, and features a story from my life. I might share my current thoughts and talk about what&#8217;s on my mind. Or maybe I share an update on what&#8217;s going on in my life right now. Or I might even tell a funny or crazy story from my past. The Fluency Files is kind of like my audio diary that you get to listen into. Now let&#8217;s talk about how you can study with the Fluency Files. Of course, these are only suggestions and you can study with the series any way you want. Each learner is different. And one of the awesome things about the Fluency Files series is that you can study with it in the way that works best for you. But to get you started, I&#8217;m going to share six tips, six suggestions, six ways that you can study with the Fluency Files. So here we go.<br />
Step number one is listen. The first step that you need to do is simply just listen to the Fluency Files episode. If you don&#8217;t understand everything, that&#8217;s fine. Try just to grab the general meaning and get the gist of the story and what I&#8217;m talking about. You might have to listen several times, but hey, that&#8217;s totally fine. In fact, the more times you listen, the better. Step two. Okay, now it&#8217;s time to grab the study guide. Each Fluency File episode comes with a study guide that includes a transcript, a glossary, definitions and example sentences of two key expressions from the episode and also fill in the blanks listening exercise.<br />
So after doing your initial listening to the episode, you are ready to deconstruct the episode by studying with the guide. So, what should you do? Well, you can listen while following along with the transcript. Read the transcript, break it down, and check out the glossary and key expression definitions to help you understand what the difficult vocabulary is. At this point, guys, you really want to use the transcript to your advantage to make sure you can understand as much as possible.]]></itunes:summary>

Read the fine print! Anytime you sign up for a new service or buy a new device, there’s usually a Terms and Conditions page that one must read and agree to before using the service or device. However, most people simply scroll to the bottom of the page, click the Agree button, and move on without even glancing at the long lines of tiny print. This is not advisable, however, because you could have unknowingly given your permission for that service or company to sell your data to the highest bidder.<br />

Transcript <br />
Hey everyone, it&#8217;s Andrew here and I have a quick announcement for you. This upcoming Friday, November 27th at 7pm Korean Standard Time, Kassy and I will be doing a YouTube live stream event for all Culips members. Our monthly live streams are a new membership benefit. And they are a way for us to connect with all of the people who support Culips and to spend some time with all of our members.<br />
Kassy and I will be online for about an hour hanging out with you all and we&#8217;ll be happy to chat with you, answer any questions that you have about learning English, and we&#8217;ll also spend some time talking about the theme for this month&#8217;s live stream, which is Thanksgiving and the holiday season.<br />
To watch the live stream simply log on to your Culips account on our homepage Culips.com and follow the link that is posted to the dashboard.<br />
So once again, the live stream will be taking place on Friday, November 27th at 7pm Korean Standard Time. So, this week on Friday. And I hope many Culips members will join us.<br />
To find out what time the live stream is happening where you live, just do a Google search for a time zone converter and you can easily see when we&#8217;ll be live in your region. In the future, we&#8217;ll be doing the streams at a time that&#8217;s convenient for our members who live in Europe and the Americas as well.<br />
So, please look forward to that in the upcoming months. So guys, that&#8217;s it. Have a great week, everyone and I&#8217;ll see you this Friday at 7pm for the live stream. Bye!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

            <itunes:summary>In this Catch Word episode, Andrew and Kassy introduce some vocabulary and expressions about
                receiving moral support. We’re going to look at two expressions that we use when talking about giving
                and getting moral support. And moral support is when you support somebody, kind of like emotionally. So
                it’s kind of emotional support when you are listening to someone and agreeing with someone and you’re on
                that person’s side, you approve of what they’re doing, this is moral support. And it’s a little bit
                different than other types of support, for example, financial support, where you’re giving somebody
                money, right? It’s not really that, you’re just more being a good friend to someone and supporting them
                that way. So we’ll take a look at these expressions you can use when talking about moral support today.

Episode description<br />
In this episode of Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips, I&#8217;d like to talk about the terrible twos. Do you have something like this in your native language? In English, we have this term, the terrible twos. This term describes a developmental stage in which young children under the age of three throw temper tantrums quite often, and say no to seemingly everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points that Jeremy covers in this episode<br />
<br />
* The “terrible twos” are a developmental stage in which toddlers throw temper tantrums quite often and say “no” to seemingly everything<br />
* As language learners, we must also go through this phase in which we do not know how to communicate what we want or need and often get frustrated as a result.<br />
* The fully developed native speaker in you must be like the patient parent, helping the little one to learn to communicate what it needs.<br />
* This phase will pass, just as it does with young children. Continued repetitive exposure to content in English combined with deliberate practice is the fastest way to get out of this phase.<br />
* The number of hours you invest will dictate how fast you grow and improve.<br />

In this episode of Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips, I would like to talk to you about how to help yourself improve your English by raising a baby English speaker in your head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points that Jeremy covers in this episode<br />
<br />
*  Everyone knows that babies learn language quite quickly and effortlessly. Why do adults seem to struggle so much?<br />
*  Children are open minded and open hearted. They aren’t afraid to make mistakes and they know the power of repetition.<br />
*  When you start learning a language, you are like a child in that language.<br />
*  The fully developed native speaker in you must be like the parent to the English learner child.<br />
*  Guidance, encouragement, support, and practice are all ways that the “parent” can help the “child” learn better.&lt;/<br />

Fun facts<br />
Pizza traces its origins to the Greeks and Egyptians, who cooked a flatbread and topped it with olive oil and spices. Today’s more modern pizza started in Naples, Italy. It has evolved as it spread around the world and countries developed their own regional spins. In Brazil, chefs top their pizzas with green peas. In France, they love fried eggs on their slices. In China, a crust made of mini hotdogs is popular.<br />
And then there’s Canada, home of the Hawaiian pizza. In 1962, Greece-born Sam Panopoulos was bored with the traditional mushroom, bacon, and pepperoni toppings, so he decided to put some canned pineapple on pizza instead!<br />

Episode description<br />
Have you ever struggled with making friends with English speakers? If so, then this episode is for you. Now, we&#8217;ll be talking about some cultural stuff in this one as well. And since there are many different English speaking countries around the world, I will use the word English speaker to refer to people who speak English as their native language.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points that Jeremy covers in this episode<br />
<br />
* Show interest in what English speakers have to say and their stories.<br />
* Don’t ask questions about physical appearance, marital status, personal finances, politics or religion.<br />
* Ask questions about what English speakers likes and dislike.<br />
* Compliment the choices English speakers make.<br />
* Choices are highly important in English speaking culture.<br />

Episode description<br />
In this episode of Jeremy&#8217;s English Tips, we are going to be talking about your comfort zone. Now, there is a very commonly used expression in English and it goes: to step outside of one&#8217;s comfort zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this lesson:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* “To step outside of one’s comfort zone” is a commonly used expression meaning that someone is doing something they are not yet comfortable doing. It doesn’t come easily to them yet.<br />
* Your “English comfort zone” is the collection of topics that you feel comfortable talking about in English.<br />
*  Identify the holes and fill them. In other words, figure out what topics, sentence forms, or pronunciation points are difficult for you and fix them by exposing yourself to content that includes those things.<br />
*  Practice with a language exchange partner by talking about what your weaknesses are and sharing how you are going about strengthening them.<br />
*  Make repetitive listening a major part of your study routine and choose your listening content wisely so as to help expand your comfort zone.<br />

Episode description<br />
Today&#8217;s topic is breath support. Sometimes when we&#8217;re in an important meeting, an interview or maybe a class presentation, we might find that we&#8217;re kind of nervous, right? Our nerves go up, our body temperature goes up. Our breathing starts getting shallow. And we tend not to have a lot of what we call vocal presence and breath support.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick tip takeaways<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Breath support is using our lungs and diaphragm efficiently so that we don’t damage our vocal folds and so that we have vocal presence.<br />
* Vocal presence is having a loud enough, yet supported enough voice that fills the room and feels relaxed and at ease when you are speaking.<br />
* Remember to try stretching your back body when filling up your lungs so that you use the full capacity of your inhalation.<br />

In this episode we are going to talk about three super useful ways to share your opinion in English. Now in English, it is very common for people to share their opinions and to discuss differing opinions in a rather casual setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this lesson:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* The easiest way to share your opinion is with I think. However, this has another meaning too. It can mean that you are unsure or do not know if something is 100% true or not.<br />
* Use to me to share your opinion, but also show that you respect other people’s opinions. It can be used in formal or informal situations.<br />

* When adults learn a new language, they usually try to learn words without context.<br />
* Use as far as I’m concerned to strongly assert your opinion. If you are certain that you are right but the other person thinks differently, you can use this one.<br />

Episode description<br />
In this episode, I&#8217;d like to talk about how using stories can make memorizing words easier.  When adults try to learn a new language, they usually just try to learn words without context. Have you ever tried to memorize a long list of words? If so, then you are likely guilty of this as well. I know I am certainly guilty of this as well. So instead of studying a new word and learning its meaning in your native language, I suggest using context.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key points covered in this lesson:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Children learn a lot from repetitive reading of stories.<br />
* Words that repeat stick out to them and are easy to learn as a result.<br />
* The pictures in the book give the child context and make learning possible.<br />
* When adults learn a new language, they usually try to learn words without context.<br />
* Audio, visual, tactile, and kinesthetic information help make the memory of a word or phrase much stronger and therefore, easier to recall when the word is needed.<br />

Episode description<br />
Today, we have a quick tip for you. And today we&#8217;re going to talk about open-ended questions, and the intonation. So, when you ask a question, does it always go up at the end? Not always. Intonation. Many times people see a question mark or ask a question and automatically assume that a question should always go up in intonation. But there are actually some rules regarding questions and intonation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick tip takeaways<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Just because a questions ends with a question mark (?) does not mean the intonation or pitch should go up at the end.<br />
* Intonation is the rise and fall of pitch in speech, usually used to emphasize and stress a word in a sentence.<br />
* An open-ended question is a question that cannot be answered with yes or no. Instead, it is answered with a descriptive response.<br />
